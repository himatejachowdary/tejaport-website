### âœ… Next Steps

- Add a `LICENSE` file with the full text of the MIT license.
- Tag a release (e.g. `v1.0.0`) to denote first stable version.
- Consider adding:
  - **Changelog / Releases** section
  - **Credits** for any third-party assets
  - **FAQ** or **Known issues** (if needed)
  - **Code of Conduct** (for community projects)

Let me know if you'd like help generating the `LICENSE` file, adding a `CHANGELOG.md`, or drafting a **Code of Conduct**!
